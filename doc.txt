Project: Smart Complaint Management System
Description

This is a full-stack web application built using React (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), and MongoDB (database) with an NLP module (Python/Flask API or Node.js library) for sentiment analysis.

The system allows students/residents/employees to lodge complaints (e.g., hostel, college, office issues).
The AI module automatically analyzes the complaint text and assigns an urgency priority (High, Medium, Low) using sentiment detection and keywords.

Admins get a dashboard to track complaints, filter by status/priority, and view analytics on trends and resolution performance.

Core Features (Must Do ✅)
1️⃣ User Features

Register/login (JWT auth).

Submit complaint with category, description, and optional file/image.

Get notified when status changes.

2️⃣ Admin Features

3️⃣ AI/NLP Module

Analyze complaint text using sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral tone + urgency keywords).

Assign priority level:

High: urgent, angry, negative sentiment (“no water for 2 days”, “broken electricity”)

Medium: normal complaints (“WiFi slow”, “need cleaning”)

Low: casual/non-urgent issues (“fan speed low”, “painting required”)

4️⃣ Visual Analytics

Admin dashboard with charts (React + Chart.js / Recharts).

Show:

Number of complaints per category

Complaint resolution times

Priority distribution (High/Medium/Low)

Optional Advanced Features (Good for Resume 🌟)

Role-based access (Students vs Admins).

Search & filter complaints by keywords.

Notification system (Email/SMS when status updates).

Export complaints report (CSV/PDF).

Chatbot for auto-response (FAQ-based).
